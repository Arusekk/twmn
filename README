Twmn is a notification system which is adapted to work with tiling window managers.
The notifications are shown as a single line which is the usual size of the top/bottom bar,
so no popup, just a notification slide.


# twmnc
    The command line client program. Sends notification requests to twmnd. Even though this
    program is more powerful, you can still use notify-send to send your notifications.
    See twmnc --help for more infos.

# twmnd
    The daemon program. Listen no notification requests and show them one after another.
    This uses a config file which is usually located at /home/$USER/.config/twmn/twmn.conf
    and contains the following, INI format. You should give twmnd a first launch so
    it can create the default configuration file :

    # [gui]
