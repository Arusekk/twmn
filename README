Twmn is a notification system adapted to work with tiling window managers.
The notifications are shown as a single line which is the usual size of the top/bottom bar,
so no popup, just a notification slide.


# twmnc
    The command line client program. Sends notification requests to twmnd. Even though this
    program is more powerful, you can still use notify-send to send your notifications.
    See twmnc --help for more infos.

# twmnd
    The daemon program. Listen no notification requests and show them one after another.
    This uses a config file which is usually located at /home/$USER/.config/twmn/twmn.conf
    and contains the following, INI format. You should give twmnd a first launch so
    it can create the default configuration file :

    # [gui]
    background_color : background color, HTML style [#000000 ; #FFFFFF] or svg style (blue, red, lightgray, etc ...)
    foreground_color : Same here for the font color.
    height   : The height of the notification slide, useful to match the height of
	       your tiling window manager bar.
    position : The position of the notifications. Available values are :
		- top_right
		- top_left
		- bottom_right
		- bottom_left
    absolute_position : An absolute position for the top-left corner of the slide.. You may need
			to setup this for extended desktop setup (multi-screen). You still have to set position
			in order to choose the slide animation. If this value is empty, twmd will try to
			figure out where to display the slide according to your desktop size
			and the value of position.
			Format : WxH with W and H two integers.
    font : The font family. For example : font=Sans
    font_size : The font pixel size.
