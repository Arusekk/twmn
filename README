Twmn is a notification system which is adapted to work with tiling window managers.
The notifications are shown as a single line which is the usual size of the top/bottom bar,
so no popup, just a notification slide.

    See twmnc --help for more infos.

    --layout : This specifies a layout name. A specific configuration file next to twmn.conf which is
		used for this layout. The layout take precedence over the twmn.conf and
		twmnc parameters take precedence over the layout.

# twmnd
    The daemon program. Listen no notification requests and show them one after another.
    This uses a config file which is usually located at /home/$USER/.config/twmn/twmn.conf
